# Save and Restore Training (WIP)

The following example illustrates
* how to save and restore the training process initialized with AutoDist
* how to load a pre-trained model and continue to train/tune with AutoDist

Note
* The example here needs to hide the `strategy_builder` args in `AutoDist(resource_spec_file)`.
Because the next page is the first page that introduces strategy builders.
